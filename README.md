It is a prove of concept for a Samsung Smart TV application. This project was created during the [Swiss Smart TV Hackathon 2014](http://www.samsung-hackathon.ch) and won the 2. prize.

## Frontend (TV)

Displays the tournaments. We used mostly HTML5 and Javascript for the UI.

## Backend (Server)

Symfony 2 webapp which handles stores the data. Currently there's no GUI which let's you add data. The backend has a REST API which is used for communication with the frontend application
